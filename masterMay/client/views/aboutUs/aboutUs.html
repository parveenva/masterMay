			<p class="pClassAu">You have worked really hard for the last four years. You have taken some really, hard courses. You have volunteered. You have worked during the summer. You have practiced every day for your high school sports team. You have taken part in extra-curricular activities.</p>
			<p>And yet all this is not enough for the college application process. Between June and December, besides doing all of the above, you are now required to write that fabulous college essay that truly expresses who you are. Remember the famous line preached by college admissions officers: Your essay should be such that if you were to drop it without your name on it in the school, someone else should be able to read it and tell that it belongs to you! In other words, you are now supposed to be an expert writer who should be able to express in 600 or so words everything that you have achieved without writing about them explicitly!
Our goal is to make that easy for you by providing a repository of thousands of essays (hopefully with your help and those that have gone through this painful process before you) so that this task becomes completely easy and give you a stress-less final year of college.</p>
			<p>We promise that we will never disclose your privacy information including your name or email and continue to grow this project in the most ethical manner possible.</p>
